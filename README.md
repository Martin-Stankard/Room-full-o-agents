# Room-full-o-agents
Abstract until json.cfg "Chatroom full of LLM driven agents". Ollama llama3.21b driven ( cause I like local and small) . Use case 1 is a dungeons and dragons-esque game creating/making api calls for images and text to speech.

always Docker-compose up

-phase zero is bang out some folders and index.js. Agent and room oop zone under backend.
- phase 1 
-- import working mern stack project
  - swap out react for streaming equiv (prob ugly and simple) mern app, with system time to show streaming
  - add header w/links.
  - chatroom link for settings, page-spa-component && chatroom console is HUGE 75%% of height footer WITH SYSTEM TIME BANG. 3x system times on ui...why...keeps things hopping...
  -- logs all ui events in "verbose mode/per tab", per link-tab-page output is colored per tab s
  -- server is a color
  - load json and csv page
  -- send that to db/ db page o db testing buttons with text input fields.
